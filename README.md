# Ably Flutter Plugin

![flutter_integration](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/actions/workflows/flutter_integration.yaml/badge.svg)

A
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
plugin wrapping the
[ably-cocoa](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa) (iOS)
and
[ably-java](https://github.com/ably/ably-java) (Android)
client library SDKs for [Ably](https://ably.io/), the realtime data delivery platform.

Ably provides the best infrastructure and APIs to power realtime experiences at scale, delivering billions of realtime messages everyday to millions of end users.
We handle the complexity of realtime messaging so you can focus on your code.

## Development Preview

We are actively working on implementing the full Ably feature set in this plugin,
so please do not hesitate to get in touch if you are interested in using Ably from your Flutter apps,
especially if there is a feature or capability in particular that you think we should prioritise.

## Supported Platforms

### iOS

iOS 9 or newer.

### Android

API Level 19 (Android 4.4, KitKat) or newer.

_This project uses Java 8 language features, utilising [Desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
to support lower versions of the Android runtime (i.e. API Levels prior to 24)_

If your project needs support for SDK Version lower than 24, Android Gradle Plugin 4.0.0+ must be used.
You might also need to upgrade [gradle distribution](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-plugin) accordingly.

## Running the example

- Clone the repo
- cd to `example` folder
- run `flutter packages get` to install dependencies
- `flutter run` will start the application on connected android / iOS device

## Usage

### Specify Dependency

Package home:
[pub.dev/packages/ably_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/ably_flutter)

See:
[Adding a package dependency to an app](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app)

### Import the package

```dart
import 'package:ably_flutter/ably_flutter.dart' as ably;
```

### Configure a Client Options object

```dart
final clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions.fromKey("<YOUR APP KEY>");
clientOptions.logLevel = ably.LogLevel.verbose;  // optional
```

### Using the REST API

Creating the REST client instance:

```dart
ably.Rest rest = ably.Rest(options: clientOptions);
```

Getting a channel instance

```dart
ably.RestChannel channel = rest.channels.get('test');
```

Publishing messages using REST:

```dart
// both name and data
await channel.publish(name: "Hello", data: "Ably");

// just name
await channel.publish(name: "Hello");

// just data
await channel.publish(data: "Ably");

// an empty message
await channel.publish();
```

Get REST history:

```dart
void getHistory([ably.RestHistoryParams params]) async {
  // getting channel history, by passing or omitting the optional params
  var result = await channel.history(params);

  var messages = result.items;        // get messages
  var hasNextPage = result.hasNext(); // tells whether there are more results
  if(hasNextPage){    
    result = await result.next();     // will fetch next page results
    messages = result.items;
  }
  if(!hasNextPage){
    result = await result.first();    // will fetch first page results
    messages = result.items;
  }
}

// history with default params
getHistory();

// sorted and filtered history
getHistory(ably.RestHistoryParams(direction: 'forwards', limit: 10));
```

Get REST Channel Presence:

```dart
void getPresence([ably.RestPresenceParams params]) async {
  // getting channel presence members, by passing or omitting the optional params
  var result = await channel.presence.get(params);

  var presenceMembers = result.items; //returns PresenceMessages
  var hasNextPage = result.hasNext(); //tells whether there are more results
  if(hasNextPage){
    result = await result.next();     //will fetch next page results
    presenceMembers = result.items;
  }
  if(!hasNextPage){
    result = await result.first();    //will fetch first page results
    presenceMembers = result.items;
  }
}

// getting presence members with default params
getPresence();

// filtered presence members
getPresence(ably.RestPresenceParams(
  limit: 10,
  clientId: '<clientId>',
  connectionId: '<connectionID>',
));
```

Get REST Presence History:

```dart
void getPresenceHistory([ably.RestHistoryParams params]) async {

  // getting channel presence history, by passing or omitting the optional params
  var result = await channel.presence.history(params);

  var presenceHistory = result.items; // returns PresenceMessages
  var hasNextPage = result.hasNext(); // tells whether there are more results
  if(hasNextPage){
    result = await result.next();     // will fetch next page results
    presenceHistory = result.items;
  }
  if(!hasNextPage){
    result = await result.first();    // will fetch first page results
    presenceHistory = result.items;
  }
}

// getting presence members with default params
getPresenceHistory();

// filtered presence members
getPresenceHistory(ably.RestHistoryParams(direction: 'forwards', limit: 10));
```

### Using the Realtime API

Creating the Realtime client instance:

```dart
ably.Realtime realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
```

Listening for connection state change events:

```dart
realtime.connection
  .on()
  .listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
    print('Realtime connection state changed: ${stateChange.event}');
    setState(() {
      _realtimeConnectionState = stateChange.current;
    });
});
```

Listening for a particular connection state change event (e.g. `connected`):

```dart
realtime.connection
  .on(ably.ConnectionEvent.connected)
  .listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
    print('Realtime connection state changed: ${stateChange.event}');
    setState(() {
      _realtimeConnectionState = stateChange.current;
    });
});
```

Creating a Realtime channel instance:

```dart
ably.RealtimeChannel channel = realtime.channels.get('channel-name');
```

Listening for channel events:

```dart
channel.on().listen((ably.ChannelStateChange stateChange){
  print("Channel state changed: ${stateChange.current}");
});
```

Attaching to the channel:

```dart
await channel.attach();
```

Detaching from the channel:

```dart
await channel.detach();
```

Subscribing to messages on the channel:

```dart
var messageStream = channel.subscribe();
var channelMessageSubscription = messageStream.listen((ably.Message message){
  print("New message arrived ${message.data}");
});
```

Use `channel.subscribe(name: "event1")` or `channel.subscribe(names: ["event1", "event2"])` to listen to specific named messages.

UnSubscribing from receiving messages on the channel:

```dart
await channelMessageSubscription.cancel();
```

Publishing channel messages

```dart
// both name and data
await channel.publish(name: "event1", data: "hello world");
await channel.publish(name: "event1", data: {"hello": "world", "hey": "ably"});
await channel.publish(name: "event1", data: [{"hello": {"world": true}, "ably": {"serious": "realtime"}]);

// single message
await channel.publish(message: ably.Message()..name = "event1"..data = {"hello": "world"});

// multiple messages
await channel.publish(messages: [
  ably.Message()..name="event1"..data = {"hello": "ably"},
  ably.Message()..name="event1"..data = {"hello": "world"}
]);
```

Get Realtime history

```dart
void getHistory([ably.RealtimeHistoryParams params]) async {
  var result = await channel.history(params);

  var messages = result.items;        // get messages
  var hasNextPage = result.hasNext(); // tells whether there are more results
  if(hasNextPage){    
    result = await result.next();     // will fetch next page results
    messages = result.items;
  }
  if(!hasNextPage){
    result = await result.first();    // will fetch first page results
    messages = result.items;
  }
}

// history with default params
getHistory();

// sorted and filtered history
getHistory(ably.RealtimeHistoryParams(direction: 'forwards', limit: 10));
```

Enter Realtime Presence:

```dart
await channel.presence.enter();

// with data
await channel.presence.enter("hello");
await channel.presence.enter([1, 2, 3]);
await channel.presence.enter({"key": "value"});

// with Client ID
await channel.presence.enterClient("user1");

// with Client ID and data
await channel.presence.enterClient("user1", "hello");
await channel.presence.enterClient("user1", [1, 2, 3]);
await channel.presence.enterClient("user1", {"key": "value"});
```

Update Realtime Presence:

```dart
await channel.presence.update();

// with data
await channel.presence.update("hello");
await channel.presence.update([1, 2, 3]);
await channel.presence.update({"key": "value"});

// with Client ID
await channel.presence.updateClient("user1");

// with Client ID and data
await channel.presence.updateClient("user1", "hello");
await channel.presence.updateClient("user1", [1, 2, 3]);
await channel.presence.updateClient("user1", {"key": "value"});
```

Leave Realtime Presence:

```dart
await channel.presence.leave();

// with data
await channel.presence.leave("hello");
await channel.presence.leave([1, 2, 3]);
await channel.presence.leave({"key": "value"});

// with Client ID
await channel.presence.leaveClient("user1");

// with Client ID and data
await channel.presence.leaveClient("user1", "hello");
await channel.presence.leaveClient("user1", [1, 2, 3]);
await channel.presence.leaveClient("user1", {"key": "value"});
```

Get Realtime Presence members:

```dart
var presenceMessages = await channel.presence.get();

// filter by Client Id
var presenceMessages = await channel.presence.get(
  ably.RealtimePresenceParams(
    clientId: 'clientId',
  ),
);

// filter by Connection Id
var presenceMessages = await channel.presence.get(
  ably.RealtimePresenceParams(
    connectionId: 'connectionId',
  ),
);
```

Get Realtime Presence history

```dart
void getPresenceHistory([ably.RealtimeHistoryParams params]) async {
  var result = await channel.presence.history(params);

  var messages = result.items;        // get messages
  var hasNextPage = result.hasNext(); // tells whether there are more results
  if(hasNextPage){    
    result = await result.next();     // will fetch next page results
    messages = result.items;
  }
  if(!hasNextPage){
    result = await result.first();    // will fetch first page results
    messages = result.items;
  }
}

// presence history with default params
getPresenceHistory();

// sorted and filtered history
getPresenceHistory(ably.RealtimeHistoryParams(direction: 'forwards', limit: 10));
```

Subscribe to Realtime Presence messages

```dart
// subscribe for all presence actions
channel
  .presence
  .subscribe()
  .listen((presenceMessage) {
    print(presenceMessage);
  },
);

// subscribe for specific action
channel
  .presence
  .subscribe(action: PresenceAction.enter)
  .listen((presenceMessage) {
    print(presenceMessage);
  },
);

// subscribe for multiple actions
channel
  .presence
  .subscribe(actions: [
    PresenceAction.enter,
    PresenceAction.update,
  ])
  .listen((presenceMessage) {
    print(presenceMessage);
  },
);
```

## Caveats

### RTE6a compliance

Using the Streams based approach doesn't fully conform with
[RTE6a](https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/features/#RTE6a)
from our
[client library features specification](https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/features/).

#### The Problem

```dart
StreamSubscription subscriptionToBeCancelled;

// Listener registered 1st
realtime.connection.on().listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
  if (stateChange.event == ably.ConnectionEvent.connected) {
    await subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();       // Cancelling 2nd listener
  }
});

// Listener registered 2nd
subscriptionToBeCancelled = realtime.connection.on().listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
  print('State changed');
});
```

In the example above, the 2nd listener is cancelled when the 1st listener is notified about the "connected" event.
As per
[RTE6a](https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/features/#RTE6a),
the 2nd listener should also be triggered.
It will not be as the 2nd listener was registered after the 1st listener and stream subscription is cancelled immediately after 1st listener is triggered.

This wouldn't have happened if the 2nd listener had been registered before the 1st was.

However, using a neat little workaround will fix this...

#### The Workaround - Cancelling using delay

Instead of `await subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();`, use

```dart
Future.delayed(Duration.zero, (){
    subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();
});
```
